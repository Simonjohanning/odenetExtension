## Description
Working repository for tools to extend the [odenet repository](https://github.com/hdaSprachtechnologie/odenet) with current data and associations

The first attempt was to build an .xml file from an openthesaurus dump. The adaptations made to the original code and the structure of the data is documented in the adaptations.md file.
